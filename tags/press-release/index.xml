      <description>San Diego, CA - Software developer Dillon Baird has successfully recreated the user interface (UI) of SpaceX&amp;rsquo;s Crew Dragon spacecraft in just 60 days. The project, called &amp;ldquo;MUTANTdragon,&amp;rdquo; was a personal challenge for Baird to improve his skills and potentially impress the team at SpaceX.
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of SpaceX and the incredible work they are doing to advance space exploration,&amp;rdquo; said Baird. &amp;ldquo;I wanted to challenge myself and see if I could recreate their Crew Dragon UI in a short amount of time, using only my own skills and resources.</description>
