      <description>The World Wide Web and I have something in common: We both began our journey in 1991. While I&amp;rsquo;m just a dude in a vast world, and the internet has transformed global communication, it&amp;rsquo;s a humble thought to realize we&amp;rsquo;ve grown side by side.

Instead of getting lost in your story, you&amp;rsquo;re wrestling with the sun&amp;rsquo;s glare bouncing off the screen.</description>
